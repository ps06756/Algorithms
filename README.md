# Algorithms
This repository will contain many of the popular and not so popular data structures and algorithms used in computer science. 
We will start by creating some of the common data structures like heap, bst, linked list etc and then move on to their more complicated variants. Wherever possible we will also show the benchmarking of the data structure.
